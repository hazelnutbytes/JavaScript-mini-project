# JavaScript Typing Speed Test

## 1. Project Overview

This is a web-based typing speed test application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate real-time user interaction, event handling, DOM manipulation, and logical implementation using core JavaScript concepts.

The application allows users to type randomly generated words within a fixed time limit and calculates their typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM).


## 2. Features

1. Random word generation.
2. Real-time key detection using event listeners.
3. Instant feedback for correct and incorrect letters.
4. Countdown timer to control game duration.
5. Automatic word switching after completion.
6. WPM calculation at the end of the game.


## 3. Technologies Used

1. HTML for structure.
2. CSS for styling.
3. JavaScript (ES6) for application logic.


## 4. Implementation Details

1. Used DOM manipulation to dynamically render words on the screen.
2. Implemented keyup event listeners to capture user input.
3. Compared typed characters with expected characters using conditional logic.
4. Used setInterval() to implement the countdown timer.
5. Managed word data using arrays.
6. Calculated WPM using a time-based formula.
7. Organized the program using reusable functions for better code structure.


## 5. Learning Outcome

1. Improved understanding of JavaScript event handling.
2. Gained practical experience with DOM manipulation.
3. Learned how timers work using setInterval().
4. Practiced writing structured and reusable JavaScript functions.
5. Built a fully interactive web application from scratch.
